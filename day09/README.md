This algorithm takes as input the "subjects.txt" file and creates an analysis based on it, plotting for each assignment which students submitted on time, late, or did not submit at all.

To do so, the code normalizes the assignment's name and the students' names. Additionally, the code performs browser scraping to extract the data on when and at what time the student submitted their assignment. This information was extracted since the "subjects.txt" file displays the last update time for each issue, not the time it was opened. To avoid changing the source data, the code creates new MD and JSON files called “submissions” and uses those files for plotting.

Then the code plots the matrix and curve figures. The matrix plot presents for each student whether they submitted an assignment on time, late, or never submitted it at all.
The curve plot presents, for each student, the time the assignment was submitted, how early, and how late. Assignments that were not submitted are not presented in this figure. Since there are many students, the curve plot is divided into two subplots.

Pls note that while running the "plot_submissions.py" Python will ask you if you want to include "Final Project Proposal" or not. I provide this choice since the deadline hasn't passed yet.

# Day09 Submissions Analysis

This folder contains two scripts:

- `main.py`: builds normalized submission data from GitHub issues or `subjects.txt` and writes `submissions.json` + `submissions.md`.
- `plot_submissions.py`: creates visualizations from `submissions.json`.

## main.py logic (high level)

1) **Read deadlines**
   - `deadlines.md` is parsed into a dictionary of project -> deadline (UTC). Projects with `None` have no deadline.

2) **Get submissions**
   - When `USE_SCRAPED = True`, issues are fetched from the GitHub API and the issue `created_at` timestamp is used as the submission time.
   - When `USE_SCRAPED = False`, data is read from `subjects.txt` (tab-delimited) and the timestamp is taken from the last column.

3) **Normalize project titles**
   - Day variants are normalized (e.g., `day 1`, `Day01`, `Day 01` -> `Day01`).
   - `Final Project Proposal` variants are normalized to one title.
   - Combined projects like `Day 05 and 06` are split into two entries (`Day05`, `Day06`).
   - Known non-project items are skipped (`Missing Day03 and Day08 Issues`, `Day09`).

4) **Normalize submitter names**
   - Case differences are merged (e.g., `einav litvak` -> `Einav Litvak`).
   - Hyphens are treated like spaces (e.g., `Steinitz-Eliyahu` -> `Steinitz Eliyahu`).

5) **Compute on-time status**
   - `delta_seconds = submitted_at - deadline`.
   - `on_time = True` if `delta_seconds <= 0`, else `False`.
   - `delta_human` is a readable signed time (hours or days + time).

6) **Write outputs**
   - `submissions.json` and `submissions.md` are written with projects ordered from `Day01`..`Day08`, then `Final Project Proposal`.
   - Entries inside each project are sorted alphabetically by submitter.

## plot_submissions.py logic (high level)

- **Matrix plot** (`submission_matrix.png`)
  - X axis = submitters, Y axis = projects.
  - Green = on time, red = late, dark = missing/unknown.
  - The color mapping is fixed so late entries appear red.

- **Timeline plot** (`submission_timeline.png`)
  - X axis = projects, Y axis = hours relative to deadline.
  - Each submitter is a separate line with a fixed color across plots.
  - Missing projects create gaps (lines do not connect across missing points).
  - The prompt asks whether to include `Final Project Proposal`.

## How to run

```powershell
python main.py
python plot_submissions.py
```

If you want to use `subjects.txt` instead of GitHub scraping, set `USE_SCRAPED = False` in `main.py`.
