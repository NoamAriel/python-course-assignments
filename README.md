I created a file function that for wanted concetration and known mass of LiBr, determise required water volume for prepering the solution.

I worte this program by my own, with help from Gabor to fix the errors I got during thw coding.

first, I write the logic of the program in notes.

then, as we saw in the lecture, I added "try" that make sure the valuves the user inputted are numbers.

Since we are people and use to confusided with units, I asked the user to confirmed that he is aware of the units.

to do so, I prints the message, and asking for input Y (yes) or N (no), using if and elif (else if). in case of No, the user have to do input the numbers again.
