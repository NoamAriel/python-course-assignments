hi

I want to write a program that know to extract the all familiy names in the order Trichoptera.

to extract the data, the program should etract it from the following website:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caddisfly

## then, the program didnt succeed, so me and the AI did debugging in that way. I copied the code the AI wrote, run teh code and send to the AI the output I got from python. we did 10 cycles of debugging this way until we got the last version which is work.
